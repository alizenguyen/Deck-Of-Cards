# Deck of Cards

Utilizing the deck of cards API (http://deckofcardsapi.com/), make a network request to "shuffle" or generate a deck of cards. With the returned deck id, make subsequent network requests drawing 2 cards at a time. Keep drawing until each suit's Queen card is drawn. Then stop. Provide separate lists of all cards drawn for each suit. At most make one network request each second.
